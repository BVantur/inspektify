# Getting started

### 1. Gradle
This library is available on mavenCentral. To use it in your project add following repository if you don't have it yet.

```
repositories { 
    ...
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Add the library dependency to your project like this:

```
commonMain.dependencies {
    ...
    debugImplementation("io.github.bvantur:inspektify:1.0.0-alpha01") // TODO
}
```

### 2. Kotlin
You need to configure the library wherever you are creating a Ktor client in your project. Configuration follows the defined design of the Ktor library by installing a plugin directly to the Ktor client. 
Minimum code for including Inspektify library to the project is:

```
HttpClient() {
    ...
    install(InspektifyKtor)
}
```

# Features

This library was built with flexibility in mind. We don't want to force the behavior of the library upon the developer who uses this library, so we implemented a couple of configurations for the library to make it more flexible.

### 1. Presentation type
By default the library detects shake gesture of the device and show the list of network transactions that happened within the app. But we want to enable developers to override this behavior if that suits them better.
That is why we introduced `presentationType` configuration to our Inspektify configuration.

You can choose between
`PresentationType.AutoShake` // selected by default
or
`PresentationType.Custom`

You can change that behavior when installing our plugin to Ktor client like this:

```
install(InspektifyKtor) {
    presentationType = PresentationType.Custom
}
```

If you choose `PresentationType.Custom` you also need to provide a way to show Inspektify debug tool in some other way. For that purpose there is a way to start Inspektify tool debug window with the next code:

```
InspektifyKtor.startInspektify()
```

### 2. Log level
By default, logging of network communication in-app output is not enabled. But if you want you can enable it in the same way as we do it for the presentation type.
The settings property that we can change for the logging is `logLevel`

You can choose between
`LogLevel.None` // selected by default
or
`LogLevel.Info`
or
`LogLevel.Headers`
or
`LogLevel.Body`
or
`LogLevel.All`

You can change it when installing our plugin to Ktor client like this:

```
install(InspektifyKtor) {
    logLevel = LogLevel.All
}
```

Here you can see what each LogLevel does when configured for your client:
- `LogLevel.None` -> doesn't log anything
- `LogLevel.Info` -> logs only base information of network transaction like url, method and response code.
- `LogLevel.Headers` -> prints everything that `LogLevel.Info` prints plus all the headers of request and response.
- `LogLevel.Body` -> prints everything that `LogLevel.Info` prints plus all the payload sent with request and response.
- `LogLevel.All` -> prints everything for a network transaction.
